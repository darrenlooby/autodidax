Personal Project Ideas for learning that use “big” systems and small versions of real world ideas.

## Why
Learning via experience is pretty much the only way to get going in development. There are lots of ways to learn, but working on real projects that achieve real goals... that's where the big learns happen.

In a world of decreasing cost, and increasing complexity, developers need to apply themselves personal projects with ever more real world applicability. Cloud is fast becoming default, so building things that work nodally - is important. High resilience and availability are the norm.

Building basic version of the tools you use in real life can help you get a deeper understanding and become much more able to fix problems and more familiar with their solutions.

## General Idea

If you’re development and staging process works on a single machine – you’re missing a huge part of the development picture. Building tools and projects that use multiple threads, on multiple machines, with multiple channels of communication… brings learning much closer to real world.
